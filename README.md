RMHS Robockets Scripts
======================
Have a neat script that isn't big enough to warrant its own repository? Throw it here! This is the team's temporary solution until GitHub starts supporting Gist for organizations.

The license in the [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Team4761/scripts/blob/master/LICENSE) file in the root of the repository only applies if there isn't another license applied.
